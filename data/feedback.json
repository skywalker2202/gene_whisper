The user has provided a medical research context and is asking about downstream signaling in the kidney involving specific proteins like CCN1, TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, Wnt, Hedgehog, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the relevant information from the context. Looking through each point:\n\n1. The study focuses on early phase paracrine signaling.\n2. In severe renal injury, tubular epithelial cells cycle arrest and produce pro-inflammatory/profibrotic mediators like TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, Wnt, Hedgehog, etc.\n3. Upregulation of CCN1 occurs in the early phases due to ligand-receptor interactions in vitro and specific transcriptomics in vivo.\n4. Single-cell studies show upregulation in CKD and AKI kidneys.\n5. RNA-seq shows transient upregulation just after kidney transplant, like IRI conditions.\n6. qPCR data: TF markers (Havcr1, Lcn2), Ccl2, Adgre, fibrotic markers are lower in IRI CCN1-KO mice than WT.\n7. The mechanism includes FAK-ERK signaling and KBP role in recruiting fibroblasts.\n8. CCN1 promotes fibroblast chemotaxis through FAK-ERK signaling, which reduces fibrosis in AKI kidneys after injury.\n\nPutting this together, the downstream signaling likely involves TGF-\u03b2/CTGF pathways.
