40236555,PMC11995211,"The M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in regulating cardiovascular functions and mediation of central muscarinic effects, such as movement, temperature control, and antinociceptive responses. Molecular probes targeting this receptor are therefore important in exploring its pathophysiological role at a molecular level. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a new fluorescent probe for M2R based on an anthranilamide ligand. In radioligand binding experiments, the presented Oregon Green 488-labeled conjugate (33) exhibited high M2R affinity (Ki = 2.4 nM), a moderate preference for the M2R over the M4 receptor, and excellent to pronounced M2R selectivity compared to the M1, M3, and M5 receptors. The utility of the probe was demonstrated in confocal, two-photon, and stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy (STED) imaging to specifically label the receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. These properties suggest that our probe may be utilized in advanced microscopy to study the pharmacology of the M2R.","Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with five subtypes (M1–M5) divided into two functional classes based on G protein coupling: M1, M3, and M5 with Gq and M2 and M4 with Gi/Go. Activation of mAChRs by agonists like acetylcholine (ACh) triggers biochemical and electrophysiological responses, depending on the receptor subtype and location. Involved in both central and parasympathetic nervous systems, muscarinic receptors are therapeutic targets for conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), addiction, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease.− Designing subtype-selective mAChR ligands remains a significant challenge for medicinal chemists. Early efforts focused on compounds with a pyridobenzodiazepinone core (1, 2), but their selectivity versus other muscarinic receptor subtypes is modest (Figure 1). The discovery of potent M2R antagonists led to the synthesis of piperidine analogues, including 3, a highly potent and selective antagonist with poor pharmacokinetics. Further optimization focused on reducing clearance rates and enhancing selectivity, leading to antagonist 4, which replaces the (2-methyl)benzoyl group of 3 with an anthranilic acid amide. This compound (4) shows high M2R selectivity, good oral bioavailability, and in vivo efficacy in rats. Various fluorescent probes for muscarinic receptors prepared by the conjugation of a ligand with a fluorophore have been reported in the literature. These fluorescent ligands are based on derivatives preferring the M1 subtype, e.g., pirenzepine,− telenzepine, and AC-42, and those preferring the M3 subtype, e.g., tolterodine. Few studies used ligands (structurally closely related to pyridobenzodiazepinones shown in Figure 1) with various fluorescent dyes having high affinity but moderate selectivity for M2R (Figure 2). These probes exhibit potential for use in imaging and binding studies with evidence suggesting a dualsteric mode of action.− Unfortunately, despite all efforts, these fluorescent M2R ligands lack selectivity toward the M1 and M4 receptors. In recent years, modern high-resolution imaging techniques have become useful and common tools for visualization and dynamic monitoring. Confocal microscopy is a widely used technique for studying the labeling of proteins with fluorescent probes− while there are a number of examples of two-photon microscopy and stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy (STED) reported in the literature.− Two-photon and STED imaging techniques offer efficient visualization with significant advantages over confocal microscopy for three-dimensional fluorescence imaging. These benefits include enhanced 3D resolution and a minimized photodamage. In the present study, we report a new fluorescently labeled anthranilamide-type M2R ligand using Oregon Green 488 (OG488) fluorescent dye to improve the selectivity and to broaden the scope of the application compared to existing probes. The OG488 fluorophore was chosen because it has a high extinction coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield, and it is suitable for both two-photon microscopy and STED imaging.","While searching for selective M2 antagonists in the literature, we selected compound 4. Based on the published data obtained by radioligand displacement assays, 4 shows high affinity (Ki = 0.2 nM) on the M2 receptor and exhibits remarkable selectivity toward most muscarinic receptor subtypes with values of 2926, 2722, 148, and 186 against M1, M3, M4, and M5, respectively (Figure 1). As the experimental binding mode of this compound is unknown, computational tools have been used to predict its binding pose and to design the appropriate attachment point and length of the linker. For these structure-based calculations, we started from the crystal structure of the receptor available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 5ZKB). As our selected ligand core differs from the ligand in the experimental structure, induced fit docking calculations have been run that allow the movement and adaptation of the side chains in the binding site in order to determine the binding mode of the ligand (Figure 3). Several plausible binding poses have been obtained; therefore, we have further assessed their stability with binding pose metadynamics. In the most plausible binding mode (Figure 3a), the ligand is stabilized in a dualsteric binding mode occupying the orthosteric pocket and also extending toward the extracellular vestibule interacting with residues on the top part of TM2,3,7 and ECL2. The molecule is anchored to the conserved Asp1033.32 by a hydrogen bond and further stabilized with two additional hydrogen bonds with Asn4046.52 and Tyr4267.39. Linker attachment on the free amine group was chosen as the best exit vector since it is positioned toward the extracellular side and allows the elongation of the ligand without installing additional substituents into the core. Docking calculations into the grid prepared based on the ligand-bound structure obtained from IFD showed that two PEG3 linkers positioned the attachment of the Oregon Green 488 dye well outside the extracellular side of the receptor, therefore allowing the ligand core of the conjugate to occupy the same binding pose as the original small ligand. Based on the information obtained from the molecular docking studies, a novel fluorescent antagonist for the M2 receptor was synthesized featuring an OG488-based probe. The synthetic route to the desired probe is illustrated in Schemes 1–3. For the first step, we developed an efficient solvent- and chromatography-free synthesis of sulfone 14 (Scheme 1). We have found that bromobenzene could be acylated with 3-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (13) in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) at 80 °C to afford the expected sulfone (14) in excellent yield. Then, we followed the literature procedure for the synthesis of intermediate 17. Boc-protected methylidene piperidine 15 was treated with 9-BBN to form a borane intermediate (16), which was then coupled with bromoarylsulfone 14 in the presence of a palladium catalyst to produce compound 17. The Boc group was removed, and the corresponding amine was generated as its TFA salt (18). Then, N-alkylation with 1-Boc-4-bromopiperidine followed to give 19. Subsequently, compound 25 was prepared using the available literature protocols (Scheme 2). The synthesis of the final intermediates containing the PEG functionalized tail was started by selective protection of one amino group of commercially available 22 with Boc2O in DCM. The resulting Boc-protected amine was coupled with 2-iodobenzoic acid under copper catalysis at room temperature to give 23. The next step was the removal of the Boc functional group under acidic conditions to generate the corresponding amine as its TFA salt (24). The carboxylic acid group of compound 20 was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide to afford 21. Then, the amine (24) was N-acylated with NHS-ester-activated compound (21) to give compound 25. The Boc group in 19 was removed, and the resulting piperidine (26) was coupled with various carboxylic acids (Boc-2-Abz-OH, 23, 25) under standard conditions (Scheme 3). The Boc protecting group was then removed, and three different amine intermediates were obtained (28, 30, 32). Finally, 32 was coupled to the appropriate commercially available OG488 succinimidyl esters. The novel fluorescent conjugate 33 was isolated and purified by preparative HPLC. Additionally, the chemical identity of new compounds and that of the probe was confirmed by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Next, we investigated the photophysical properties of the fluorescent probe 33. In acetonitrile, the probe has an absorption maximum at 520 nm and a fluorescence maximum at 547 nm with a Stokes shift of 27 nm. The molar extinction coefficient (ε = 42504.9 M–1 cm–1), fluorescence quantum yield (Φf = 0.20), and brightness (f = 8501) values are lower than those of the original dye but are considered adequate for future biological applications. Figure S1 shows the absorbance and fluorescence spectra of probe 33 in various solvents, including DCM, dioxane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), THF, toluene, water, and acetonitrile. Higher solvent polarity correlated with increased fluorescence intensity, while aqueous media showed a lower intensity. The dye was pH sensitive, with intensity increasing at higher pH. Following a literature procedure, we examined the effect of protein (BSA) on the ligand. We found that the absorbance, excitation, and emission maxima show no significant change in PBS with and without BSA, as shown in Figure S1. Finally, to prove the ability for biological application, we have investigated the photostability of 33 in PBS (pH 7) excited with UV light (4 W, 450 nm). Half of the original fluorescence intensity was reached after 10 min of irradiation, which is still considered appropriate because a typical imaging process does not require longer continuous excitation. The M1R–M5R affinities of the intermediates 28, 30, 32 and the fluorescently labeled derivative 33 were determined at membranes from CHO cells transfected with hMxR (x = 1–5) using the orthosteric antagonist [3H]-scopolamine (N-methyl) as a radioligand (for competition binding curves, see Figure S2). Before testing the fluorescent probe (33), we checked for the binding affinity and selectivity of the base derivative (28) and the PEG linker-containing derivatives (30, 32). The corresponding Ki values are listed in Table 1. We observed that the initial molecule (28) exhibited lower selectivity for the M4 receptor than previously reported in the literature. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in the assay conditions used during our testing. Interestingly, the application of the dye enhances the selectivity of the molecule across all four additional receptors (M1, M3–5). The new fluorescent ligand 33 we developed is a more selective M2R probe compared to the dibenzodiazepinone-type fluorescent compounds reported in the literature. Its selectivity for the M1 and M3 receptors is particularly notable, while its selectivity for the M4 and M5 receptors is comparable to those of previously published compounds (see Figure 2). The ability of the compounds to antagonize the carbachol-induced G protein activation of M2R was assessed using the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based TRUPATH GoA activation assay (Figure 4A,B). All synthesized compounds (28, 30, 32, and 33) acted as competitive antagonists, displaying similar half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) values (Table 2). The suitability of the fluorescent compound for BRET-based ligand binding measurements was also evaluated (Figure 4). In these experiments, binding of the fluorescent receptor ligand to the BRET donor-fused receptor construct ensures a molecular proximity, resulting in resonance energy transfer and an increase in the BRET ratio (Figure 4C). The specificity of the signal can be verified by treatment with nonlabeled competitive receptor ligands, which prevents the BRET signal. To generate the BRET donor labeled receptor construct, we fused the bright Gaussia luciferase enzyme to the N-terminus of M2R. In our measurements, a concentration-dependent and specific increase in the BRET signal was observed after treatment with 33, yielding a dissociation constant (KD) of 119 nM (Figure 4D). This value is higher than the Ki value obtained from the radioligand binding assay, likely due to differences in the experimental conditions and the receptor constructs used. The amplitude of the specific BRET ratio change was relatively low, potentially reflecting a suboptimal orientation of the BRET partners, which may have limited the efficiency of the resonance energy transfer. However, the low variability in the signal ensured precise and reliable measurements. Competitive ligand binding measurements were performed using unlabeled M2R ligands, specifically atropine and compound 28 (Figure S3). This assay also proved to be effective for determining kinetic ligand binding parameters (Figure 4E,F). The calculated association and dissociation rate constants were 8.06 × 10–3 s–1 M–1 and 8.67 × 10–4 s–1, respectively. Having validated 33 as a selective and useful fluorescent probe for M2R pharmacological investigations, we next examined the potential for visualization of M2R in live transfected HEK 293T cells by confocal microscopy. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Cerulean-labeled M2 receptors, and nontransfected cells were used as controls. The images revealed significant labeling in M2R–Cerulean-expressing cells (Figure 5A) after addition of 33, whereas no labeling was observed in nontransfected cells (Figure 4B). The signal of 33 was not detected on the control cells during the examined time frame (3 min), but on the transfected cells, it remained unchanged. For additional confocal images, see Figures S4, S5, and S9. To evaluate the specificity of the binding, the receptors pretreated with atropine show no labeling with ligand 33, as shown in Figure S6. Confocal microscopy results confirmed the selective labeling of 33 against M2 receptors. Based on the encouraging results, we have evaluated its potential in two-photon and higher-resolution imaging techniques. We examined live M2R cells with two-photon microscopy as well (Figure 6). A labeling pattern similar to that observed in the confocal microscopy studies was identified. Figure 6A illustrates 33 labeling in HA–M2R-transfected cells. The labeling can be observed selectively only at the plasma membrane of cells where the receptors can be found. Similarly to the confocal images, no dye labeling was detected inside the cells. Figure 6B presents a microscopic image of nontransfected cells, showing a minor degree of autofluorescence. When the probe was applied to these nontransfected cells, no receptor labeling was observed. This investigation confirmed the usefulness of the fluorescent probe in two-photon microscopy and demonstrated the labeling of the M2 receptors in living cells. For additional two-photon images, see Figures S7 and S8. As STED microscopy is used for the deeper investigation of cellular processes even at the subcellular level, we challenged the fluorescent probe 33 in STED nanoscopy (Figure 7). For STED, we used the same transfected cells as in the case of two-photon microscopy. Using the STED function and the available largest magnification objective, we observed improvement of optical resolution. The 33 green signal is concentrated in the membranes of cells, where the M2Rs are located. In conclusion, the diverse functions and structural characteristics of the M2 receptor make it a critical target for understanding its role under various physiological and pathological conditions. Extending the possibilities of molecular level investigations, we have developed a new anthranilamide-based fluorescent probe for M2R. The conjugate has a nanomolar affinity toward M2R (Ki = 2.4 nM) and demonstrates greater selectivity compared to the previously reported dibenzodiazepinone derivatives. The OG488-labeled probe (33) exhibits suitable photophysical properties (λabsmax: 520, λmaxem: 547, ε: 42504.9 M–1 cm–1, Φf: 0.20), making it highly suitable for microscopy. In order to demonstrate its versatility, we successfully applied it in confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy imaging, and STED imaging with living cells. Due to the selected Oregon Green 488 dye, the ideal kinetic properties, and beneficial selectivity profile, the probe has the potential to unlock new avenues for investigating M2R trafficking, interactions, and its involvement in diverse signaling pathways at high resolution with a broad range of microscopic methods.",,"Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of a New Fluorescent Ligand for the M<sub>2</sub> Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor."
40196581,PMC11974930,,,,,Multiple Wnt signaling pathways direct epithelial tubule interconnection in the regenerating zebrafish kidney.
40224016,PMC11987671,"Humoral factors that prompt fibroblasts to migrate to an injury site at an appropriate time point are deemed indispensable for repair after kidney injury. We herein demonstrated the pivotal roles of injured tubule-derived cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1) in the mobilization of fibroblasts to the injury site after kidney injury. Based on analyses of ligand-receptor interactions in vitro and tubular epithelial-specific transcriptomics in vivo, we identified the up-regulation of CCN1 during the early phases of kidney injury. CCN1 promotes fibroblast chemotaxis through focal adhesion kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Invivo analyses utilizing tubular-specific CCN1 knockout (KO) mice demonstrated the sparse accumulation of fibroblasts around injured sites after injury, resulting in ameliorated tissue fibrosis in CCN1-KO mice. These results reveal an epithelial-fibroblast CCN1 signaling axis that mobilizes fibroblasts to injured tubule early after acute injury but that promotes interstitial fibrosis at late time points. Injured tubular epithelia secrete CCN1 following acute kidney injury CCN1 promotes fibroblast chemotaxis through FAK-ERK signaling CCN1-KO in tubular epithelia reduces fibroblast accumulation at injury sites CCN1-KO in tubular epithelia ameliorates tissue fibrosis after severe kidney injury Biochemical mechanism; Molecular interaction; Integrative aspects of cell biology; Biology of human development","Recent epidemiological and experimental findings have shown that maladaptive tubular epithelial repair after acute kidney injury (AKI) drives the development of future tissue fibrosis. Injured tubular epithelia release various pro-fibrotic humoral mediators that accelerate the differentiation of resident pericytes and fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and the production of the extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in tissue fibrosis. However, fibrosis is an adaptive phenomenon in the post-injury repair process, and the healing of injured tissue requires a highly plastic interstitium in which fibroblasts, macrophages, and vascular cells migrate, thereby forming scar tissue. For example, the aggregation of fibroblast injury site is essential for tissue repair in skin and cardiac tissue. In the kidney fields, several reports showed the preventative role of fibroblasts on the fibrosis progression after injury. Based on these findings, the early mobilization of fibroblasts to injury sites may be critical for adaptive or maladaptive tissue repair. Humoral factors secreted by injured tubules are thought to induce the migration of fibroblasts to the site of injury and activate fibrotic signaling. During severe renal injury, the tubular epithelium undergoes cell-cycle arrest and secretes numerous pro-inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), Wnt, hedgehog (Hh), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which induce tissue inflammation and fibrosis. However, since these humoral factors are up-regulated in renal tissues in the subacute to chronic phase after injury, the mechanisms by which they act on “fibroblasts” in the acute phase and guide them to the site of injury remain unclear. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome in renal tubular epithelial cells and renal fibroblasts and identified cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1) as a candidate injured tubular epithelia-derived matricellular protein. CCN1 has been shown to bind to integrins and play a role in cell migration and proliferation. In the kidney, CCN1 was up-regulated early after injury, and neutralizing antibodies reduced renal fibrosis; however, its roles in renal injury and the repair process have not yet been elucidated in detail. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between tubular epithelial cells and surrounding fibroblasts, with a focus on CCN1 and its ability to migrate to the site of injury.","To examine the paracrine effects of epithelial cells on fibroblasts, we performed in vitro experiments using cultured media (CM) from NRK52E and NRK49F (CME and CMF, respectively, Figure 1A). Compared with CMF, CME accelerated NRK49F proliferation and migration (Figure S1). We next obtained CM from injured tubular epithelia on fibroblasts. Cisplatin up-regulated γH2AX phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-3 activation in NRK52E (Figure 1B). CM from 40 μM of cisplatin-treated NRK52E (Cis 40-CME) increased the proliferation of NRK49F (Figure 1C). The scratch assay demonstrated that NRK49F migration was accelerated more by Cis 40-CME than by untreated CME (Figures 1D and 1E) and showed chemotaxis toward Cis 40-CME (Figures 1G–1I). Regarding the migration and proliferation-related molecules, Cis 40-CME increased in the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK (Figure 1F). Regarding the effect of the severity of tubular injury on CME (Cis 20-CM vs. Cis 40-CM, Figure 1B), fibroblast migration was accelerated more by Cis 40-CME than by Cis 20-CME, whereas no significant differences were observed in proliferation or chemotaxis (Figures 2C–2E and S2A–S2C). Overall, CME from injured tubular epithelia accelerated the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts in general and directed migration of fibroblasts to more injured tubular epithelia. We next examined differences in the transcriptome between NRK52E treated with 40 μM of cisplatin or vehicle by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We also compared the transcriptome between NRK49F treated with Cis 40-CME and untreated CME. Unsupervised analyses of gene expression by a principal component analysis revealed that the transcriptional landscapes of untreated and cisplatin-treated NRK52E and untreated CME-treated and Cis 40-CME-treated NRK49F were separated into independent clusters, indicating distinct gene expression patterns for each experimental group (Figures 1J and 1K). We annotated gene expression using the Gene Ontology biological process and found that terms related to cell migration were up-regulated in Cis 40-CME-treated NRK49F (Figures 1L and 1M). To identify the mediators secreted from injured epithelial cells responsible for this effect, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of ligands in cisplatin-treated NRK52E that act in a paracrine manner. Boiling CME for 1 h significantly attenuated the Cis 40-CME-mediated acceleration of NRK49F migration, suggesting that a protein/peptide was responsible (Figure S3). Based on previous findings on the molecules up-regulated in the earlier phase after AKI and up-regulated receptors in Cis 40-CME-treated NRK49F, we identified Ccn1 as a candidate (Figures 1N and 1O). We confirmed the up-regulation of the CCN1 protein in both cell lysates and CME from injured tubular epithelia in which Havcr1 mRNA, a tubular injury marker, was increased after cisplatin treatment (Figures 1P–1S). To examine the up-regulation of CCN1 in injured proximal tubules (PTs), we used bigenic mice with a PT-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre (SLC34a1GCE) and the tdTomato reporter (R26tdTomato). After exclusively labeling PTs, 15 mg/kg of cisplatin was injected into mice (Figure 2A). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was increased by the cisplatin injection (Figure 2B), and tdTomato+ tubular epithelia were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures 2A and 2C). PAS staining showed extensive tubular injury, and immunofluorescence staining revealed positive staining of KIM1, a tubular injury marker, and reduced staining of LTL, a tubular integrity marker, in tdTomato+ cells (Figure 2D). A qPCR analysis of RNA from isolated tdTomato+ epithelia and whole kidney tissue revealed that the expression of Ccn1 and Havcr1 was significantly up-regulated after injury, whereas the expression of other profibrotic genes, namely, Tgfb1, Ctgf, and Pdgfb, did not change after the cisplatin injection (Figures 2E and 2F). To generalize the up-regulation of CCN1 after injury, we further analyzed its expression in various kidney injury models (Figure S4A). In the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model, Ccn1 expression was up-regulated 3 days after injury in a manner that was dependent on the severity of injury (Figures S4B and S4C). In the aristolochic acid injury model, qPCR demonstrated that Ccn1, tubular injury markers, and fibrosis-related mediators were up-regulated 14 days after injury (Figures S4D and S4E). In the unilateral ureteral ligation model, Ccn1 was up-regulated after surgery and gradually decreased thereafter, whereas the markers of other profibrotic mediators (Ctgf, Tgfb1, and Pdgfb), myofibroblasts (Acta2), and ECM (Fn1, Col1a1) gradually increased (Figures S4F–S4H). We also analyzed CCN1 expression using the publicly available transcriptomics database of the human kidney (Figure S5). Bulk RNA-seq of a whole transplanted kidney revealed that the transient up-regulation of CCN1 occurred just after kidney transplant, a condition that simulates IRI in the human kidney (Figure S5A). Single-cell-based transcriptomics of healthy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and AKI human kidneys indicated the up-regulation of CCN1 in PTs of the AKI kidney (Figures S5B and S5C). While the expression of CCN1 was also observed in healthy and CKD kidneys, CCN1 correlated with the expression of HAVCR1, indicating that subclinically injured PTs expressed CCN1 even in heathy human kidneys (p = 0.013, R2 = 0.14, Figure S5D). Overall, the up-regulation of CCN1 after injury was observed in multiple independent AKI models and in humans, and the dynamics of its expression were distinct from other well-known profibrotic factors released from injured tubular epithelia. We next examined the effects of human recombinant CCN1 on fibroblasts. Recombinant CCN1 increased the proliferation of NHDF, a human fibroblast cell line (Figure 3A), and migration (Figures 3C and 3D), whereas it did not affect alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression (Figure 3B). A gradient of CCN1 (0–2 μg/mL) significantly increased chemotaxis in NHDF (Figures 3E–3G). Based on its local interaction with integrins, a receptor of CCN1, we focused on the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway. Western blotting revealed that the phosphorylation of FAK (pFAK) and its downstream molecules (pERK, pAKT) was increased by CCN1 in NHDF (Figure 3H). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed the up-regulation of pFAK in CCN1 treated-NHDF (Figure 3I). Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the pFAK also increased in Cis 40-CME-treated NRK49F (Figures 3I and 3J). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the number of pFAK+ cells increased around the KIM1+ injured tubules after cisplatin injection in vivo, and bulk of pFAK+ cells were positive for PDFGRβ, indicating that fibroblasts accumulated at the injury site (Figure 3K). Similar findings were observed in the mice that received IRI (Figure 3L). We next examined whether CCN1 regulates fibroblast migration and contributes tissue fibrosis after injury in vivo by generating a tubule-specific knockout (KO) of CCN1 in AKI using mice (hereafter referred to as CCN1-KO for homozygous mutant mice). To directly confirm the deletion of CCN1 in PTs, we generated trigenic mice with a SLC34a1GCE allele, a R26tdTomato allele with or without CCN1-KO. After the exclusive labeling of PTs, mice were sacrificed 2 days after the cisplatin injection (Figure 4A). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that PTs were labeled with tdTomato in both CCN1-KO and wild-type (WT) mice, and KIM1 expression was detected in both injured kidneys (Figure 4B). Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on sorted tdTomato+ tubular epithelial cells demonstrated the loss of Ccn1 gene expression in CCN1-KO mice (Figure 4C). We next analyzed the effect of PT-specific deletion of CCN1 on uninjured kidneys (Figure S6A). There was no difference in BUN and renal histology between CCN1-KO and WT mice 10 days and 24 days after last tamoxifen injection (Figures S6B and S6C). qPCR analysis demonstrated that there were no significant differences in expressions of Havcr1, Slc34a1, Lrp2, Tgfb1, Pdgfrb, Fn1, and Acta2 between WT and CCN1-KO mice (Figure S6D), suggesting that PT-specific loss of CCN1 function did not affect any morphological and functional changes at baseline. We then analyzed the effect of PT-specific deletion of CCN1 on cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Serial measurements of BUN showed that BUN increased at 4 days after cisplatin injection and returned to baseline; there was no difference between WT and CCN1-KO mice (Figure 4D). We first checked the phenotypes 4 days after cisplatin injection when its nephrotoxicity became histologically evident in PAS staining and γH2AX immunostaining (Figures S7A and S7B). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that γH2AX+ tubular epithelial cells were found in both CCN1-KO and WT mice treated with cisplatin and that PDGFRβ+ interstitial fibroblasts cells accumulated around tubules containing γH2AX+ cells in WT mice, but not in CCN1-KO mice (Figure 4E). pFAK+ cells accumulated around KIM1+ injured tubules only in WT mice, not in CCN1-KO mice, and bulk of interstitial pFAK+ cells were positive for PDGFRβ (Figure 4E). qPCR analysis demonstrated that there were no significant differences in expressions of Havcr1, Tgfb1, Pdgfrb, and Acta2 between WT and CCN1-KO mice; however, Vim was slightly increased and Slc34a1 was slight decreased in CCN1-KO mice (Figure S7C). At 14 days after cisplatin injection, Sirius red staining showed mild interstitial fibrosis, but there was no difference between WT and CCN1-KO mice (Figures 4F and 4G). qPCR analysis demonstrated that there were no significant differences in gene expressions of the tubular injury, tubular integrity, macrophages, and fibrosis markers between WT and CCN1-KO mice (Figure 4H). We further examined the effect of Ccn1 deletion on the severe AKI model, 35 min unilateral IRI (Figure 5A). We confirmed the loss of Ccn1 gene expression in CCN1-KO mice with IRI by RT-PCR on sorted tdTomato+ tubular epithelial cells (Figures 5B and 5C). We next checked the phenotypes 1 day after IRI and extensive tissue injury was evident in both WT and CCN1-KO mice in PAS staining (Figure S8A). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that pFAK+ cells accumulated around KIM1+ injured tubules in WT mice, but not in CCN1-KO mice (Figure 5D). Bulk of accumulated interstitial pFAK+ cells were positive for PDGFRβ (Figure 5D). qPCR analysis demonstrated that there were no significant differences in expressions in tubular injury markers, integrity markers, and fibrosis-related markers between WT and CCN1-KO mice, but Ccl2 and macrophage marker were rather increased in CCN1-KO mice at 1 day after injury (Figure S8B). At later time point of 14 days after IRI, Sirius red staining showed the extensive interstitial fibrosis in IRI kidneys, and it was significantly attenuated in CCN1-KO mice (Figures 5E and 5F). qPCR analysis at 14 days after injury demonstrated that gene expressions of the tubular injury markers (Havcr1 and Lcn2), Ccl2, Adgre, and fibrosis markers (Pdgfrb, Acta2, Col1a1, Fn1, and Tgfb1) were significantly lower in IRI kidneys of CCN1-KO mice than those of WT mice (Figure 5G). Overall, PT-specific deletion of Ccn1 reduced the accumulation of pFAK+ cells into the tissue injury site and ameliorated subsequent tissue fibrosis only after severe injury (35 min IRI), but not after mild injury (cisplatin nephrotoxicity). To test the further mechanistic insights, we generated CCN1-KO NRK52E using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing. We targeted the gene-editing site to exon 2, which precedes sequences encoding integrin-binding sites (Figure 6A). We isolated single-cell colonies in which CCN1 expression was completely lost in both cell lysates and CME (Figures 6B and 6C). CM from cisplatin-treated CCN1-KO NRK52E (CCN1-KO Cis 40-CME) failed to increase the proliferation and migration of NRK49F compared to Cis 40 CME control (Figures 6D–6F). The chemotaxis and chemokinesis of NRK49F were observed between CME from cisplatin-treated NRK52E with or without CCN1-KO (Figures 6G–6I). In addition, increases in the chemotaxis and chemokinesis of NRK49F mediated by CM from cisplatin-treated NRK52E disappeared following the deletion of CCN1 in NRK52E (Figures 6J–6L). Western blotting revealed that the phosphorylation of ERK by Cis 40-CME was partially inhibited by the deletion of CCN1 in NRK52E (Figure 6M). To examine the role of CCN1-FAK signaling in NRK49F migration, we knocked down Ptk2 (encoding FAK) in NRK49F by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. qPCR and western blotting demonstrated that siRNA transfection down-regulated Ptk2 mRNA and FAK protein expression (Figure 7A). This Ptk2 knockdown indeed significantly reduced the Cis 40-CME-mediated acceleration of NRK49F migration, chemotaxis, and chemokinesis (Figures 7B–7F). Western blotting demonstrated that the Cis 40-CME-mediated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in NRK49F was also attenuated by the knockdown of Ptk2 (Figure 7G). Regarding the effects of the pharmacological inhibition of FAK on CCN1 signaling, western blotting demonstrated that FAK inhibition reduced the CCN1-mediated phosphorylation of FAK, ERK, and AKT in NHDF. CCN1-mediated cell migration was also abrogated by the FAK inhibitor. In addition, we examined the effects of ERK inhibition on CCN1-mediated NHDF migration. Western blotting demonstrated that the CCN1-mediated phosphorylation of ERK (Figures S9A and S9B) and cell migration was inhibited by the ERK inhibitor (Figures S9C and S9D). We lastly attempted to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of CCN1 in injured tubular epithelia. Based on previous findings showing the presence of two activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding sites in the promoter of CCN1, we performed a regulon analysis of RNA sequences. We identified 48 up-regulated transcriptional factors in cisplatin-treated NRK52E, including Jun (Figure S10A). We investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of c-fos/AP-1 by T5224 and found that this inhibited the cisplatin-induced up-regulation of Ccn1 in NRK52E (Figure S10B).","Fibrogenic processes after injury are shared across solid organs, including the kidneys. In the acute response initiated after insult to the kidney parenchyma and effector cells, injured tubular epithelia are activated. In the later phase, the ECM expansion occurs ultimately driving progression to fibrosis and organ dysfunction. The present study focused on the earlier phase and investigated the mechanisms underlying paracrine signaling from injured tubular epithelia to induce fibroblast mobilization toward the injury site in the acute phase after kidney injury in vitro and in vivo. We identified injured tubule-derived CCN1 as a strong candidate in a comparative transcriptomic analysis of injured tubular epithelia and CM from injured epithelia-treated fibroblasts. CCN1 is up-regulated earlier after injury, but its expression rapidly decreases thereafter, and its dynamics in vivo differed from those of well-known mediators involved in kidney fibrosis, such as TGF-β and CTGF. CCN1 regulates fibroblast chemotaxis and chemokinesis through FAK-ERK signaling in vitro. In addition, the loss of CCN1 expression in tubular epithelia diminished the mobilization of fibroblasts toward injured tissue in vivo, and the subsequent tissue fibrosis was inhibited in severe IRI. These findings suggest that CCN1 is specifically involved in the local accumulation of fibroblasts at injury sites in the earlier phase of the fibrogenic process, but it is indispensable for developing tissue fibrosis at later time points after severe AKI (Figure 7K). CCN1 was initially identified as a cysteine-rich protein encoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene. In the human adult kidney, CCN1 expression was observed in podocytes and whole segments of tubular epithelia including PTs. In the IRI kidney, CCN1 has been shown to be rapidly up-regulated in the PTs at 1 h and its expression peaked between 12 and 24 h after injury. Given this rapid increase in CCN1 expression after injury, urinary CCN1 is regarded as a candidate biomarker of injured PTs in the super acute phase of AKI. Our results describing CCN1 expression dynamics after various kidney injuries also revealed its up-regulation in the earlier phase and a reduction in its expression thereafter, which is in contrast to other profibrotic factors. In addition, our results demonstrated that CCN1 did not up-regulate Acta2 mRNA expression, a marker of myofibroblasts. These results suggest that the role of CCN1 is specific for the mobilization of fibroblasts toward injury sites in the acute phase after injury, and not necessarily for ECM production or the transdifferentiation of pericytes and fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Roles for CCN1 in tissue injury and repair processes have been examined in injury models of various organs yielding conflicting reports. Two studies from the same research group demonstrated that a neutralizing antibody against CCN1 ameliorated kidney fibrosis in the chronic phase of IRI and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys. In contrast, CCN1 has been reported to limit tissue fibrosis in other organs including in CCl4-induced or bile duct ligation-induced liver injury models, in cutaneous wound healing models, and in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. In liver fibrosis, CCN1 induced senescent phenotypes in surrounding fibroblasts, thereby reducing tissue fibrosis in the chronic phase after injury. The results obtained herein from CCN1-KO mice suggested that the pro-fibrotic roles of CCN1 in the kidney depend on the severity of tissue injury. Given the small effect of CCN1 on the myofibroblast transdifferentiation and ECM synthesis in fibroblasts, CCN1 from injured tubules specifically acts as an alarm of the tissue injury, resulting in the fibroblast accumulation. In case of severe injury like 35 min IRI in our experiments, the profibrotic mediators like TGF-β or PDGF, which are subsequently released at the later time point, contribute to the maladaptive repair and tissue fibrosis. CCN1 has been shown to play a role in tissue injury and repair processes by interacting with disparate cell types through specific integrin receptors. Based on a previous study showing that CCN1 activated FAK, leading to the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, and our transcriptomics data, we focused on FAK as a target signaling molecule of CCN1. FAK was initially described as a protein that is highly phosphorylated upon the clustering of integrins at focal adhesions. We found that CCN1 phosphorylated FAK at the Tyr397 residue, which is the major FAK activation site. FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 allows its kinase domain to bind to various kinases, including Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase C-γ, and these kinases may further activate downstream signaling, including ERK, eventually accelerating cell migration. We showed that the genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of FAK canceled fibroblast migration mediated by CCN1 and by CM from injured epithelia, suggesting that FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 plays a central role in this process. In conclusion, the present study revealed tubular epithelial cell-fibroblast interactions through the paracrine effects of CCN1 in vitro and in vivo. CCN1 up-regulation in tubular epithelia only occurred in the acute phase after injury, and injured tubule-derived CCN1 promoted the mobilization of fibroblasts into injury sites. In case of severe injury, subsequent up-regulation of other profibrotic mediators might contribute to the myofibroblast transdifferentiation and ECM synthesis. Therefore, inhibition of CCN1 can be an attractive therapeutic candidate to prevent the AKI to CKD transition; whether this strategy can be applied to other CKD models including UUO or repeated cisplatin injection model is unclear and, thus, further investigations are warranted. There are several limitations in this study. We focused on the paracrine interaction between injured tubular epithelia and fibroblasts through CCN1; therefore, interactions with the other cell types have not been examined. In addition, recent research has demonstrated that fibroblasts also express CCN1. Deletion of CCN1 in fibroblasts has been shown to reduce fibrous tissue in cancer and to cause qualitative changes in the ECM, including alterations in its amount and fibrous structure. Following myocardial infarction, deletion of CCN1 in fibroblasts resulted in impaired fibrosis, which ultimately led to cardiac rupture. While fibroblast-derived CCN1 has been shown to play critical roles in tissue remodeling and fibrosis in other organs, its function in renal tissue remains unclear. Although we demonstrated that c-fos/Jun/AP-1 signaling up-regulated CCN1 expression, the mechanisms by which CCN1 is down-regulated after tubular injury have yet to be elucidated. Based on the results of transcriptomics, we investigated the role of injured tubule-derived CCN1 in promoting fibroblast migration. However, it is well known that multiple humoral factors contribute to this process. Our transcriptomics also revealed the up-regulation of other humoral factors, such as CCN2, which are potentially involved in fibroblast migration, although we have not yet directly examined the individual and combined effects of these other factors on fibroblast migration. Since gender and genetic backgrounds including mouse strains affect the severity of kidney injury, whether our results can be generalized beyond these differences is unknown.",Injured tubular epithelia-derived CCN1 promotes the mobilization of fibroblasts toward injury sites after kidney injury.
